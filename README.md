# HDGraph

## What is HDGraph?

"HDG is a free tool allowing to graphically display the hard disk space usage. It shows all the directories and subdirectories of the hard drive on a single graph, allowing [you] to see the largest directories at a glance."
-Quote from [HDGraph's documentation](https://hdgraph.sourceforge.net/doc/en/HDGraph.htm)

HDGraph was originally created by Jean-Yves Laugel. It is hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hdgraph/) and was created with [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/). It was last updated in 2015 with the release of version 1.5.1.

## What are the goals of this project?

The goals of this project are to:

- [ ] Update HDGraph to use modern technologies (most notably .NET 7/8 and WiX)
- [ ] Modernize the UI (potentially with a new framework, WinUI 3?)
- [ ] Pave the way for new features

## What is the roadmap for this project?

Firstly, I want to get the version with .NET 7.0 fully working. Then, I want to provide a proper installer (potentially with WiX) or consider a portable solution. After that, HDGraph will be ready for its first release (probably called 2.0). Once that is done, I want to start working on an improved UI and eventually new features.

## Who am I?

I'm Jacob, a software developer from Germany. I'm currently studying at university and I'm planning on working on this project in my free time. I'm still learning C# and .NET, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

## Why is there a single folder called HDGraph containing everything?

This is a remnant from the original project and I'm planning on changing it in the future.
